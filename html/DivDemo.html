        <h2 class="food">Milk</h2>
        <p>To get the full benefits of milk, including the nine essential nutrients, the USDA says adults should consume
            three servings of milk (or cheese or yogurt) each day. A serving size is 1 cup of milk or yogurt, 1.5 ounces
            of natural cheese or 2 ounces of processed cheese. So, go aheadâ€”drink your milk. It's good for you.</p>

        <h2>Soda</h2>
        <p class="food">Drinks naturally high in sugar like 100% fruit juices are also featured. While juice often contains healthful
            nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals, it should also be limited as it contains just as much
            sugar (though from naturally occurring fruit sugars) and calories as soft drinks.</p>
