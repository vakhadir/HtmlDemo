    <h1> My HMTL page </h1>
    <p>I have 2 paragraphs in my webpage this is the first one.</p>
    <p><pre>As I type my second paragraph, I’m curious to learn why h1 has 1 in it what if I have h2, h3, h4 and why p has no
        number in it? Like Baskin and Robins has a number in it.       When American’s 
        realised it, they disliked 
        Basking and
        Robins and 
        stopped going to it. </pre></p>
